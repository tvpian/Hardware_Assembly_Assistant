# HARDWARE ASSEMBLY ASSISTANT


## Description

A complete real-time tool tracking and detection system was designed using Leap motion controller where any tool in the hand of user is detected and tracked for real-time assistance in assemblying hardwares.
The inbuilt SDK was optimized and calliberated to handle tool(hand) tracking. Whereas a CNN classifier model was used to implement tool recognition. The stereo cameras of the leap motion sensor were used to generate a dataset consisting of images of various tools with which the model was trained. Sockets were used as the main medium for transmission of data.
